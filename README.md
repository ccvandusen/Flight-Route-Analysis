## Mile High Route Analysis

### Introduction:
The National Aerospace System in the United States transports over 700 million passengers annually, and is one of the most complex transportation networks in the world. Furthermore, the FAA requires all carriers that consist of more than 1% of commercial traffic to report flight schedules, delays, revenues, and passenger statistics to the Bureau of Transportation Statistics. This provides one of the most comprehensive public datasets of private organization operations available today. I took this data and built a Random Forest Classifier to predict which routes in the network were in danger of shutting down in the near future.

### Motivation:
Before moving to San Francisco, I lived in Bozeman, Montana, which has a local airport that operates as the closest regional airport to Yellowstone National Park, and as such was a relatively busy hub airport. Frequently, Delta and other airlines would open up new routes between Bozeman and other hubs, such as San Francisco, Denver, and Boston, just to close the route several months later.
